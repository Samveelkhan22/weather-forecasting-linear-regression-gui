# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting with Linear Regression and GUI  

## 📌 Overview  
This project forecasts temperatures using a **Linear Regression model** trained on historical weather data. The system features a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for user input and provides temperature alerts.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Language:** Python 3.12  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation  
  - `numpy` – Numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` – Plotting graphs  
  - `sklearn` – Machine learning (Linear Regression)  
  - `tkinter` – GUI for user input and alerts  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Interactive GUI to enter forecast date  
- ✅ Real-time temperature prediction using Linear Regression  
- ✅ Graph visualization with predicted temperature marker  
- ✅ Warning alerts for extreme temperatures (hot or cold)  

---

## Alerts:

- ✅ If temperature < 10°C: Too Cold warning
- ✅ If temperature > 35°C: Too Hot warning
- ✅ Otherwise: Normal forecast message

## 📈 Future Improvements

- 📊 Use time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet) for better accuracy
- 🌤️ Add other weather metrics (humidity, wind speed)
- 🖥️ Develop a full web-based interface
